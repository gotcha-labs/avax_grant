# infraBUIDL() GotCHA Application

GotCHA is a novel and fun CAPTCHA platform that wants to disrupt the traditional CAPTCHA space. No one likes to click on traffic lights or stop signs. Things get even worse when you think you have answered properly and a bot tells you (a human), that you have failed to prove (to a robot) that you are a human. We are changing this. 

## Project description, including goals, expected use cases, and potential benefits for the Avalanche ecosystem


Goals: Our goal is to make the Internet a better place where humans are not exploited for work when solving a CAPTCHA and to provide an actual good experience when proving that one is not a robot.  

Expected use cases: 

- Protect dApps in the ecosystem (e.g., faucets) from bots
- Verifiable credentials for liveness checks (i.e., proof of liveness)

Benefits for the ecosystem: A fully Avalanche powered (fun) CAPTCHA solution to protect any dApp in the ecosystem from bots. 

## Roadmap

**Q4 2024:** Initial MVP of GotCHA ready to be integrated with regular websites and dApps. Feedback from initial users. 

**Q1 2025:** Game Development SDK for web3 community to build new CAPTCHA games. Initial game development from community and early builders. 

**Q2 2025:** Production-ready official release for the mainstream audience with: a) integrateable API for anyone to use GotCHA to secure their (d)Apps; b) public game generation using public SDK; and c) monetization strategies. 


## Budget & Milestones
We are requesting a total of $40,000. We believe this to be a project of small-scale. Funds will be allocated completely to cover for the development of the software and infrastructure costs over a period of 3 months (October - December).  

Milestone 0 ($5,000) - Upfront payment to kick off project

Milestones I ($5,000)- Smart Contract for worker registration and initial spin up of CAPTCHA provider infrastructure. 

Milestone II  ($10,000)- Dedicated live API for Avalanche Ecosystem for dApps to integrate.

Milestone III ($20,000) - Custom Avalanche themed GotCHA game to be served in different ecosystem (d)Apps.

## KPIs

We recommend the following KPIs:

- Number of CAPTCHAs served
- Number of integrations

These seem to be the most tangible metrics to use in such a setting like ours.  

## Team

**Duarte Fleming (AI Engineer)** - 

**Mario Yaksetig (Cryptographer)** - 

Mario is an applied cryptographer who worked with David Chaum, the creator of e-cash and online anonymous communications, on the design of novel protocols for the blockchain space. Mario's L2 work has been cited by Vitalik Buterin and is one of the creators of the quantum secure fallback primitive. Mario also wrote a [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/552.pdf) on how the Avalanche architecture is great for a blockchain-powered metaverse. 


**John Fountain (Storyboard Artist)** - 
John has held nearly every key creative position in the field of animation including Producer, Writer, Director, Storyboard Artist, Art Director, Development Artist and Character Designer. He has worked at DISNEY, NICKELODEON, WARNER BROTHERS, MTV, CARTOON NETWORK and several studios overseas. 

Fountain was the Supervising Director for Nickelodeon's THE FAIRLY ODDPARENTS and a director for MY LIFE AS A TEENAGE ROBOT. He has also contributed to DORA THE EXPLORER, OH YEAH! CARTOONS!, CHALK ZONE, THE WILD THORNBERRYS, and INVADER ZIM.

Most recently, Fountain directed a series of shorts for CARTOON NETWORK ASIA for their 'Toonix' franchise, as well as a series of shorts for NETFLIX. He also storyboarded for Adult Swim's RICK AND MORTY and animated for the feature film SOUTH PARK : BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT.

**Rob Titus (Game Design)**
Rob is a former developer at Naughty Dog. His work includes:

 - Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped

- Crash Team Racing

- Jak & Daxter series.

"I started at Naughty Dog on Crash 2 and I was responsible for objects primarily, modeling, rigging and animation. But, since we were only 11 people at the time, I did background modeling, lighting and texture placement and other art jobs that needed to be done. I worked there for 8 years for Crash 2, 3, CTR and the whole Jak and Daxter series."

Feasibility of the proposal: The team is experienced in the design and development of new cryptographic protocols, the UI element is the one to be outsourced. Therefore, the main risk of execution lies on having a very usable UI/UX at the highest level. 

Additional remarks: The team is based in Cayman Islands, a crypto friendly jurisdiction. The team members are originally from Portugal and Cayman and are not in an OFAC sanctioned jurisdiction. This should result in a smooth KYC process.
